Two Steps:
1) Check if program is correct
Stupid: Generate random test cases
Smart: Generate test cases that have full code coverage
2) Mutate Program
Stupid: Randomly mutate AST
Smart: Non-determinize random lines (this is just exhaustively doing the above?)


MOD_INVERSE is wrong, consider BASE = 1. All we require is BASE > 0, MOD > 0, (BASE,MOD)=1
